ðŸš¦ TrafficTelligence: Traffic Volume Estimation with ML:

This project predicts the number of vehicles on the road using machine learning. It helps improve traffic management and reduce congestion.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model to estimate the number of vehicles passing through a given point at different times of the day.
By leveraging historical traffic data and features like time, weather, and location, the model provides accurate traffic volume predictions.

The input to the model is historical traffic data, which includes features like date, time of day, day of the week, and weather information .
The output is the predicted number of vehicles (traffic volume) expected at a specific location and time. By giving the model new data about time and weather,
it can estimate how many vehicles are likely to pass through, helping in planning and managing traffic more effectively.

âœ… Why itâ€™s useful
*Helps cities plan traffic lights and control congestion.
*Supports better decision-making for traffic authorities.
*Can improve safety and reduce delays.

ðŸ“Š Results
$The best model predicted traffic volume with low error.
$Found that time of day and weather are important factors.
